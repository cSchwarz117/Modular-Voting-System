## Project description

Modular-Voting-System (MVS) is a web app that implements an open source voting platform. This platform will offer features that help users create open and closed elections. The system will allow admins to create elections using a suite of custom and pre-made components. 

These components will allow the admin to modularize the development of this voting system, mix and match components, and create a flexible system. This app will help serve a larger variation of elections than most current election systems are equipped to handle, with components tackling issues like security and vote format.
