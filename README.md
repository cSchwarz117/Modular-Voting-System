## Project description
Modular-Voting-System (MVS) is a web app that implements an open source voting platform. This platform will offer features that help users create open and closed elections. We believe in the importance of having access to the machines and software that power our elections along with providing security to protect those votes.

This system will be created using modular approach so that additional features such as voter authentication and special election features may be added in the future. The app will be written in python  and use the Django web framework.
